It is a Shopping website developed using HTML,CSS, Javascript for the front end and PHP, mysql at the backend.
Here we have used basic Machine Learning Algorithms.
Customers can provide the Review for the purchased products.
For the Review part we have used 2 Machine Learning Algorithms(Review.py).Support Vector Machine and Logistic Regression.
There is a button called best products in the website. If you click on that it will display the best products among all the products present in the database(best products.py)
Here we have used SVM Classifier, Random Forest Classifier and K-Neigbors Classifier. We also compare the algorithms to check which one performs the best(Accuracy will increase if we increase the number of products through admin)
Finally when the customer purchases the products, he will be recommended with the similar products. I made use of Association Rule mining technique to find the related products for the purchased products.
